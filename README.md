# AspirePlaywrightDemo
A demo of effectively using .NET Aspire and Playwright together

A lot of this functionality is derived from the dashboard screenshot demo at https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/dashboard/automation/aspire-dashboard/aspire.dashboard.screencapture/readme

I think there's an opportunity to group the three .NET Aspire and Playwright classes together along with some helper functionality into a NuGet package that could be very useful in setting up .NET Aspire test scenarios

## Playwright MCP Server

This sample uses the Playwright MCP server to do some explorative testing and then generate a complementary test for the WeatherHub project.  You can learn more and install the Playwright MCP server at https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp
