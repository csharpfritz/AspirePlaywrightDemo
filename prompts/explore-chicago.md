I want to do some exploratory testing.  launch the AppHost project and navigate to the Aspire dashboard that's reported in the output with the direction "Login to the dashboard".  Once there, identify to URL the myweatherhub service is running on and open a browser to visit it - this is a weather forecast page. Click the button with the role "Column options" in header of the name column.  Wait for a search box to appear, and fill in the search text for "Chicago". are there entries available for Chicago in the weather app?



no, don't look into those areas. instead, let's turn your exploration into a test that verified that a location sought that doesn't exist is handled properly.  I have tests already in a file called WeatherHubTests.cs
