I want to do some exploratory testing.  
- launch the AppHost project and navigate to the Aspire dashboard that's reported in the output with the direction "Login to the dashboard".  
- Identify to URL the myweatherhub service is running on and open a browser to visit it - this is a weather forecast page. 
- Wait for the grid to finish loading with city names.  
- Click the button with the role "Column options" in header of the name column.  
- Wait for a search box to appear
- fill in the search text for "Chicago". 
- are there entries available for Chicago in the weather app?
- stop the AppHost project to clean up your exploration when you are done
- if you launched a browser, close it when you are done
